# Handshake
To analyze daily internship report updates in Power BI, especially related to a "handshake" process, you'll want to focus on key metrics that reflect the progress and engagement of interns. Hereâ€™s how you might structure your analysis:

1. Data Sources :-
   - **Internship Reports**: Import the daily internship reports into Power BI, ensuring that each report includes relevant data like intern names, dates, progress, tasks completed, issues faced, and handshake events (e.g., approvals, feedback).
   - **Handshake Events**: If there's specific data related to the "handshake" process, such as approvals, feedback loops, or sign-offs, make sure these are clearly tagged or identified in the data.

2. KPIs & Metrics
   - **Daily Completion Rate**: Track how many interns complete their tasks daily.
   - **Handshake Status**: Monitor the number of handshakes completed versus pending each day.
   - **Feedback Loop Time**: Measure the time taken between task submission and handshake completion.
   - **Intern Engagement**: Track engagement levels, such as the number of tasks initiated versus completed.

 3. Visualizations
   - **Daily Trend Analysis**: Use line or bar charts to show trends in handshake completion over time.
   - **Task Completion Heatmap**: Create a heatmap to identify which days had the highest or lowest task completions.
   - **Intern Performance Dashboards**: Set up dashboards to monitor individual intern performance, focusing on the frequency and timeliness of handshake events.

 4. Analysis
   - **Identify Bottlenecks**: Use the visualizations to pinpoint where delays in the handshake process occur.
   - **Correlate Feedback with Performance**: Look for patterns between the speed of handshake completions and the overall performance or satisfaction of interns.
   - **Trend Insights**: Analyze whether certain weeks or days show higher or lower engagement and handshake completion rates.

If you have specific data in the `.pbix` file, I can guide you through setting up these visualizations or extracting particular insights from the report. Let me know how you'd like to proceed!
